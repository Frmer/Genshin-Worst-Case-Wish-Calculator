Thanks for checking out my first project, well technically this isn't my first. But think of it as a fix to the first one because the first had the wrong formula.

HOW TO USE

1. To use the calculator simply put your primo gems first.
2. Then input your intertwined fate.
3. Then confirm whether you have 50/50 on your pull.
4. And lastly put the amount of how many times you want to pull for this character, so that would mean how many constellations you want for this specific character.

The code will then tell you how many pulls you have, How many pulls you will need, and how many primos do you need to get x amount of character pulls

Feel free to enlighten me about my code, since I am an amateur at programming. Thanks again :D
